/**
 * Splits a total amount across N people, rounding each share UP to the nearest ¥100.
 *
 * The ¥100 rounding is the JP cultural convention for warikan — nobody asks for ¥17.
 * Rounding up (rather than nearest) means the organizer never ends up short.
 *
 * Returns null for invalid input (zero/negative people, negative total, NaN).
 * The caller decides how to display "no result yet" — separation of concerns.
